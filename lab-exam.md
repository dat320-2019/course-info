# Lab Exam Information

The lab exam will be held in **Week 48 (November 26 2019)** (Tentative).
Exact day and time will be provided in a separate schedule.

1. Examination is individual and covers only labs 6 and 7.

2. You **must have approved labs 6 and 7 in the regular lab hours before the lab exam**. This means of demonstrating that your code works and a few questions about your code.

3. During the lab exam you will be asked to explain the code. You are expected to know and be able to explain all the code in the relevant lab exercises, even though your group partner wrote that particular piece of code.

4. Your individual lab grade will be based on the lab handin and the lab exam.

5. Your grade will be announced at a later time after all students have completed their lab exam.

6. If you have already passed the lab exam in a previous year, you do not need to do the lab exercises again, if you only want to improve your written exam grade. If you want to improve your lab grade, you will need to complete the lab exercises again. *Warning: It is a lot of work (as you know), and we may also change the lab exercises from one year to the next.*

7. Completing the lab exam is not a pre-requisite for attending the written exam, but to get a final grade in the course, a passing grade is required for both the lab exam and the written exam. However, to attend the written exam you must get approved the five individual lab assignments.


## Lab Exam Procedure

1. Prepare your code editor on your laptop, with the relevant files open to ease navigation between the different parts of your code.

2. Please arrive ten minutes before your scheduled time and wait outside the room 423f. We will come and fetch you when it is your time.

3. The examination is expected to take about 10 minutes. Since we have limited time, it is very important that you don't waste your time fiddling with code editors and navigation. We recommend that you practice showing and explaining your code before you arrive.

4. You will be asked questions about:
   - Your design and implementation for the two labs.
   - General theory questions about labs 6 and 7.
   - Questions about Go programming language features used in the labs.
   - General questions about RPC.
